# YatraAI: A Hyper-Personalized Generative AI Travel Planner for India

YatraAI is a full-stack data and AI engineering project that redefines travel planning. It moves beyond generic, keyword-based search to deliver hyper-personalized, narrative-driven itineraries that are factually grounded and immediately actionable.

The project's core mission is to act as an intelligent travel companion. It understands a user's unique preferences for destination, budget, and travel style, and then crafts a detailed, day-by-day plan complete with an interactive map, powered by a sophisticated, end-to-end data platform.

This repository documents the architecture, data engineering, and full-stack development of the entire YatraAI platform, serving as an elite-level capstone project.

**[Live Demo - Coming Soon!]**

## ‚ú® The User Journey: A New Way to Plan

YatraAI is designed around an intuitive and immersive user experience, turning the chore of planning into a journey of discovery.

1.  **The Dream Phase (The Form):** The journey begins with a conversational, form-driven Q&A. Instead of a blank search box, the user answers engaging questions about their ideal trip:
    *   **Vibe:** Mountains, beaches, historical cities, spiritual retreats?
    *   **Logistics:** Where are you starting from? Are you willing to travel by car, train, or plane?
    *   **Budget & Style:** Are you looking for a budget-friendly hostel trip or a luxury hotel stay?

2.  **The Discovery Phase (The Results):** In seconds, YatraAI presents its recommendations not as a list of links, but as a rich, interactive dashboard:
    *   **The Narrative:** An AI-generated, beautifully written travel plan that tells the story of the trip, explaining *why* these locations were chosen.
    *   **The Interactive Map:** A split-screen view with an interactive map (powered by OpenStreetMap) showing pins for all recommended points of interest (POIs). Clicking a pin on the map highlights the relevant section in the narrative, and vice-versa.
    *   **The Structured Plan:** Alongside the narrative, a clear, scannable list of activities, restaurants, and sights with practical details fetched from the structured database.

3.  **The Planning Phase (The Aggregator):** The generated itinerary is a launchpad, not a final document. Users can see real-world logistics to make their plan a reality:
    *   **Connectivity Info:** The plan automatically shows the nearest airport and major railway station for the recommended destination.
    *   **Live Lookups (Future Scope):** Integrated buttons to "Check Flights" or "Check Trains" will call live APIs (like Skyscanner or RailYatri) to provide real-time pricing and availability, fulfilling the aggregator vision.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

YatraAI is built on a modern, scalable microservices architecture designed for the cloud. The system's intelligence comes from its unique **"Filter-then-Generate"** approach, which ensures both speed and accuracy.

First, the system performs a rapid, structured filter on a traditional database (PostgreSQL) to find the most logically relevant destinations. Then, it uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enrich these results and generate a creative, human-like itinerary.

    %% --- Diagram Title & Description ---
    %% This architecture is for a Form-Driven Generative AI Travel Platform.
    %% Key Design: A "Filter-then-Generate" approach. A fast, structured query on PostgreSQL 
    %% finds candidates. RAG is then used to create a rich, narrative response.
    %% Data Engineering: Leverages offline dumps (Wikipedia) for robust, scalable knowledge base creation.

## üß¨ The "Travel Genome": Our Data Engineering Heartbeat

At the core of YatraAI is the **"Travel Genome"**, a curated, multi-layered knowledge base housed in PostgreSQL and a Vector DB. This is not just a database; it's a structured understanding of travel in India, built by a sophisticated offline data platform.

The **Airflow-orchestrated Spark pipeline** is responsible for creating this genome by processing and integrating data from diverse sources:

*   **The Foundational Skeleton (Wikidata):** Programmatic queries to Wikidata provide a definitive list of Indian cities, national parks, and landmarks, forming the structured backbone of our locations table.
*   **The Points of Interest (OpenStreetMap):** For each location, the Overpass API is queried to fetch a rich set of POIs, including museums, restaurants, temples, and hiking trails.
*   **The Rich Narrative (Wikipedia Offline Dump):** To provide deep, descriptive context for our RAG system, the entire 50GB+ Wikipedia dump is processed by Spark. We surgically extract summaries for relevant locations and POIs, avoiding the noise of irrelevant articles.
*   **The Logistical Backbone (Open Data):** Datasets from sources like OurAirports.com and data.gov.in are used to map every location to its nearest airport and major railway station, populating the critical `nearest_airport_code` and `nearest_station_code` fields.
